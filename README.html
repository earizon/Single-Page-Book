<h1>About SPB </h1>
<ul>
    <li>SPB stands for Single Page Book. It aims at unifying books,
       mind-maps, cheat-sheet contents creation in a single web page
       that can be created and updated "a la Zettelkasten" 
       <sup>
         <a href="https://medium.com/emvi/luhmanns-zettelkasten-a-productivity-tool-that-works-like-your-brain-abe2d53a2948" target="_new">1</a>,
         <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125" target="_new">2</a>
       </sup>
       <b> in order to keep notes organized and improving throughout years/decades</b>.<br/>
       <p>
        As an indirect (not initially planned) consequence, it also provides for
        a <b>light-weight alternative to Content Management Systems (WordPress, Confluence, Plone,
        Sharepoint, ...) and Project tracking systems ("Jira", "Bugzilla", ...).</b>
       </p>
    </li>
    <li>SPB offers a pragmatical replacement for "heavy-weight"
       Content Management Systems running on complex server setups,
       by using just pure HTML/CSS consumed by web-browsers running
       on a laptop or mobile.
    </li>
    <li>Content data is moved from "always online" databases
      to plain <b>safe HTML files</b> easy to manage and backup without
      complex IT administration skills.
    </li>
    <li>Extra information about How SPB compares with some other content 
        publication and management tools can be read <a href="./index.html">here</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    SPB promotes a "best-patterns" approach to  Documentation by:
    <ul>
      <li> ✓ Putting related info close to each other.</li>
      <li> ✓ Don't repeat twice. </li>
      <li> ✓ Use your hard disk to save classified information, not documents:<br/>
          Don't keep information spread ("hidden" or "lost") amongst hundred of emails,
          posts, chats, words, custom databases, excels and binary files of
          random nature. Internet standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and a
          text editor (notepad, ultraedit, vim,...) is all you need.
      </li>

      <li> ✓ Avoid using (expensive and complex to setup and maintain) search engines
          to find for lost information:<br/>
          <b>With SPS information is never lost!!!.</b><br/>
          (<b style="color:green;">Remember: Take control of the information before
               the information takes control of you!</b>)
      </li>
      <li> ✓ Don't use proprietary formats for important documentation: <br/>
      HTML will be well supported in any electronic platform and by many
      different working groups for always, proprietary formats will not.
      </li>

    </ul>
</p>


<h1>Use-cases</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Advanced notebooks</li>
  <li>Cheat-sheets with steroids.</li>

  <li>"Light" weight database.</li>
  <li>(add your own here)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Micro "How-To"</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Install a light-weight web (HTML) server on your PC.<br/>
        An simple way is to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">download</a>
       and install python 3. Then from the terminal (Linux/Mac) or the command
       prompt (Windows) execute next 3 commands and press Enter key( ⏎ ) to confirm.
       <pre>
Command to execute:                          Explanation
C:\users\myUser > mkdir project01⏎     ←···· [m]a[k]e (or create) new [dir]ectory
                                             where the page will be stored
                                            
C:\users\myUser > cd    project01⏎     ←···· [c]hange [d]irectory

C:\users\myUser > python3 -m http.server⏎  ← Execute <b>safe</b> web server pointing
                                             (only our computer will be able to
                                              access the content server)
       </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Copy next files to the directory where pages will be placed:
        <pre>
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SinglePageBookProject/SPB/master/map_template.html">map_template.html</a>
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SinglePageBookProject/SPB/master/map_v1.css">map_v1.css</a>
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SinglePageBookProject/SPB/master/map_v1.js">map_v1.js</a>
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SinglePageBookProject/SPB/master/custom.js">custom.js</a>
        </pre>
        Rename <b>map_template.html</b> to provide a sensible name. All others files just need to be 
        downloaded once. They will be reused again and again.<br/>
        <b>"map_v1.js"</b> contains the minimum Javascript code used to navigate and react 
        to user actions.<br/>
        <b>"map_v1.css"</b> contains the Cascading Style Sheets to "beautify" the content.<br/>
        <b>"custom.js"</b> allows advanced customization. Just leave it next to the other files
        and forget.
    </li>
    <li>Point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8000" target="_new">http://localhost:8000</a> and
        click in you renamed template html file.<br/>
        Note that <b>localhost is an special safe and private address</b> pointing to your local computer.<br/>
        Nobody outside your computer can access it.<br/> 
        More info <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost" target="_new">[here]</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Congratulations! You are done. Now it's time to add notes by just adding some html blocks 
        tagged with <code>zoom</code> and <code>labels</code> attributes.<br/>
          Reload your web page to see the results. Play around until you feel comfortable 
        and <b>get ready to take control of your information Forever!!!</b>.<br/>
    </li>
</ol>

<h1>Next steps</h1>
<ul>
    <li>At some point you may be interested in sharing you information with your team or make it
        public. If that's the case you can just upload your files to any web hosting provider.<br/>
        Or you can start your server with the option <code>--bind 0.0.0.0</code> like:
<pre>
C:\users\myUser > python3 -m http.server --bind 0.0.0.0
</pre>
       Now your local web server is accessible to your local (WiFi, Ethernet or VPN) network 
       through the local IP of your PC but nobody outside in the "World <s>Wide</s>Wild Web" can
       reach it.<br/>
    </li>
    <li>It could be the case that you need to collaborate with people and take 
        control of even the smallest changes or you need to apply some workflow 
        before considering the documentation valid or rollback latest changes, or
        create different versions of the content....<br/>
         Them it is time for you to learn Git. It could be a little bit 
        scaring to get used to Git for the first time and the step learning
        curve is relatively high (about 5-15 days) but the time spent is worth
        the effort if you plan to take control of your information for the
        rest of your life.<br/>
          Git will surprise you with all its "goodies". In fact Git is the
        tool used by the "big ones" of the Internet (Google, Apple, Microsoft,
        AWS, ...). It allows to work offline and merge change among team groups
        with easy, see changes from current version to a previous one, alert 
        about conflicts when two different users edit the same information in
        parallel and helps to fix them with easy. It lets you come back to 
        past version without loosing the latest changes, create different 
        versions (branches) of the same document and merge those versions 
        later on (or just discard one of them, or part of one of them).
        <br/>
         And if Git scares you or you don't have time to learn it, don't worry!. 
        You can still deal with your documents as standard text files. Copy to 
        a backup or version folder, send as e-mail attachments, or zip with a 
        password. Leave Git apart until you have time to learn it.

<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
    <li>✓ No coding skills needed, just familiarity with HTML.</li>
    <li>✓ Navigate notes "a la Google maps" by zooming in/out, or 
        "a la Zettlekasten way" by showing related notes by topic and/or direct-link.
    </li>
    
         (rollbacks, pull requests, versioning, branching, ...)
    </li>
    <li>✓ Print to paper support:
      print-paper CSS support, useful for first-lectures (start-to-end) of content
      Ex: Two views of the same content:
      -  Map: https://singlepagebookproject.github.io/IT_notes/Blockchain/ethereum_map.html
      - book: http://www.oficina24x7.com/Blockchain/ethereum_map.pdf
    </li>
    <li>✓ All information available one click away, and related pages can be
         displayed close to each other.
    </li>
    <li>✓ save searches/sub-books classified by by-topic/text as URL bookmarks.
    </li>
    <li>✓ Quick classification/search/heat-map using topics.</li>
    <li> ✓ Designed to <b>avoid the dangerous "UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS"</b>:<br/>
         SPB is designed to show all related information as close as possible to 
         each other as to avoid missing unknown-unknowns. <br/>
          As an example, this is how Google presents QA (Quality Assurance) when
          search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=java+qa" target="_blank">
          JAVA QA related results</a> and this is how SPB presents the same
          <a href="https://singlepagebookproject.github.io/IT_notes/JAVA/java_map.html?topics=qa"
             target="_blank">JAVA QA related results</a>.<br/>
         <b>Even if Google has access to millions of different pages, it tends to
             be biased toward just an very small subset of content</b>. In particular,
         that related to automated acceptance tests.<br/>
           This probably explain why Java newbies guided by Google results tend to
         do buggy JAVA applications and, since Google page-rank favors most linked 
         pages the biased search mechanism feeds ad infinitum. <br/>
           SPB JAVA notes, manually collected&amp; classified throughout the time,
         will always present all QA related information with no bias. 
           There are no reasons to suppose that automated testing is less or 
         more important than other QA topics related to async.programming, internal 
         data collection management or persistence tools. By presenting them all 
         in parallel we decrease the danger of unknown-unknowns.
      </pre> 
    </li>
    <li>✓ Easy backup: Copy your files somewhere else, attach to an e-mail, That's all!!!
    </li>
    <li>✓ Offline navigation.</li>
